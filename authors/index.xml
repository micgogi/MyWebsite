      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a software developer with a vast array of knowledge in many different front end and back end languages, responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices. My objective is simply to be the best software developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do. I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning from more developers, remaining humble, and continuously making strides to learn all that I can about development. I studied Mathematics, and I believe that my understanding of problem solving and complex algorithms are also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
